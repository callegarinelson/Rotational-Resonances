"secao.f" is a software written in Fortran code that generates the data to construct the surfaces of sections (SOS) utilized in diverse papers (see Figures 1a, 5b, and 6 in Callegari, N.. A Hamiltonian for 1/1 rotational secondary resonances, and
application to small satellites of Saturn and Jupiter. Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simulat 138 (2024) 108224). 
The software first integrates the equations of rotation of the secondary body around the primary for a dense set of initial conditions. The equations of rotation are given in the subroutine "FORCE", and the output data for SOS resulted from the calculation in "TROCA1" routine. The numerical integrations were done in the subroutine RA15, providing numerical solutions with local error of integration of the order of a 15th-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (Everhart, E.. An efficient integrator that uses Gauss-Radau spacings. In: IAU colloquium. vol. 83, 1985, p. 185â€“202).
It is important to note that after slight modifications of the code "secao.f", it is possible to obtain the curves of temporal variation of  rotational elements (see Figures 1b,c in Callegari 2024).

"Hxy.f"  is a software written in Fortran code that generates the data to construct the level curves of the hamiltonian of the perturbed spin-orbit resonance (see Figures 2, 4, 5, and equations 26 or 34 in Callegari 2024).
